Generate one **vertical 9:16** photorealistic portrait of a **{{child_age}}-year-old {{child_gender}}**. The child must read instantly as a real kid and clearly resemble the person in **Image A** while staying age-accurate.

**INPUT REFERENCES (do not show them in the output)**

*   **Image A — Resemblance Parent** → primary identity anchor.

**IDENTITY & TRAIT FUSION**

*   Global resemblance follows **Image A** at **~90–93%**, but always preserve child craniofacial ratios: larger cranial vault vs mandible, fuller cheeks, softer jawline, slightly shorter philtrum. **Never transfer adult age markers** (wrinkles, makeup shaping, stubble).
*   **{{INHERITED_EYE_FEATURES}}**

**EXPRESSION — ALWAYS SMILING WITH UPPER TEETH**
The child must have a gentle, happy, natural smile slightly showing their upper teeth. The smile should be symmetrical and evoke warmth.

**MICRO-ASYMMETRY (avoid studio symmetry)**
Introduce subtle, realistic micro-asymmetries: one eyebrow slightly higher, a faint difference in eyelid crease, one corner of the mouth slightly more upturned.

**HAIR & BROWS**
*   Hair color family from the resemblance parent, but **about 20% lighter** with subtle sun-kissed ends; a few flyaways and baby hairs near the part. Brows same hue family, **~10% lighter than hair**, softer/sparser with child density.
*   Hair style: The child has {{HAIRSTYLE_DESCRIPTION}} // This is a style-only instruction.


**WARDROBE**
*   **Plain white T-shirt**, short sleeves, **no logos/patterns/graphics**.

**COMPOSITION & LIGHT**
*   **Bust / upper-torso portrait**: full shoulders and collarbones visible; bottom crop around **mid-chest**.
*   **Minimal headroom (1–3%)**, head placed higher; **eye line ≈30% from the top**; **do not crop the forehead**.
*   Outdoor park/greenery with soft bokeh. Warm golden-hour rim/backlight on hair plus gentle natural frontal fill; recompute shadows/reflections/catchlights consistently.

**TWO-PASS SELF-CHECK**
After first render, internally evaluate likeness and realism.
If likeness < ~90% or the face looks stylized/"doll-like" or the eyes look even slightly squinted/narrow:
1.  Increase **Image A** bias by **+8–12%** for mouth, philtrum, chin outline, cheekbone height (keep childlike nose tip/alar width; do not over-narrow).
2.  **Open eyelids by +2–4%** to a neutral child aperture while preserving the L/R micro-asymmetry.
3.  Re-apply the micro-asymmetry offsets and ensure the **upper teeth remain slightly visible** in the smile. Re-render once.

**DO NOT**
No parents in the frame; no extra people; no cloning of an adult face; no oversized eyes; no CGI/cartoon look; no heavy makeup; no extreme bilateral symmetry; no beauty-filter skin; no HDR halos; no text/borders/watermarks; no matte/black borders/black areas.
