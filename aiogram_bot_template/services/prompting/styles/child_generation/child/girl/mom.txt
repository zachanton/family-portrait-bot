Generate one **vertical 9:16** photorealistic portrait of a **7-year-old girl**. The child must read instantly as a real kid and clearly resemble the person in **Image A** while staying age-accurate.

**INPUT REFERENCES (do not show them in the output)**

* **Image A — Mother, face crop** → primary identity anchor.
* **Image B — Father, face crop** → secondary traits (iris color only).

**IDENTITY & TRAIT FUSION**

* Global resemblance follows **Image A** at **\~90–93%**, but always preserve child craniofacial ratios: larger cranial vault vs mandible, fuller cheeks, softer jawline, slightly shorter philtrum. **Never transfer adult age markers** (wrinkles, makeup shaping, stubble).
* **Iris color/pattern** comes from **Image B**. Match exactly; do not average or brighten. If the father’s iris is unclear or occluded, **fallback to Image A** with the same “match exactly; do not average/brighten” rule.

**EYES — NO SQUINT INHERITANCE**

**EXPRESSION — ALWAYS SMILING WITH UPPER TEETH**

**MICRO-ASYMMETRY (avoid studio symmetry)**

**HAIR & BROWS**

* Hair family from the mother, **about 20% lighter** with subtle sun-kissed ends; a few flyaways and baby hairs near the part. Brows same hue family, **\~10% lighter than hair**, softer/sparser with child density.

**WARDROBE**
• **Plain white T-shirt**, short sleeves, **no logos/patterns/graphics**.

**COMPOSITION & LIGHT**
• **Bust / upper-torso portrait**: full shoulders and collarbones visible; bottom crop around **mid-chest**.
• **Minimal headroom (1–3%)**, head placed higher; **eye line ≈30% from the top**; **do not crop the forehead**.
• Outdoor park/greenery with soft bokeh. Warm golden-hour rim/backlight on hair plus gentle natural frontal fill; recompute shadows/reflections/catchlights consistently.

**TWO-PASS SELF-CHECK**
After first render, internally evaluate likeness and realism.
If likeness < \~90% or the face looks stylized/“doll-like” or the eyes look even slightly squinted/narrow:

* Increase **Image A** bias by **+8–12%** for mouth, philtrum, chin outline, cheekbone height (keep childlike nose tip/alar width; do not over-narrow).
* **Open eyelids by +2–4%** to a neutral child aperture while preserving the L/R micro-asymmetry.
* Re-apply the micro-asymmetry offsets and ensure the **upper teeth remain slightly visible** in the smile. Re-render once.

**DO NOT**
No parents in the frame; no extra people; no cloning of an adult face; no oversized eyes; no CGI/cartoon look; no heavy makeup; no extreme bilateral symmetry; no beauty-filter skin; no HDR halos; no text/borders/watermarks; no matte/black borders/black areas.
