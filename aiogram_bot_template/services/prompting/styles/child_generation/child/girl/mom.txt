Generate one vertical 4:5 portrait (1536×1920, PNG) of a **7-year-old girl**. External camera (not a selfie). The child must read instantly as a real kid and clearly resemble the person from second reference image.

INPUTS
• Image A — both parents (palette & global genetics).
• Image B — MOM face crop (traits anchor).
Use references as **traits only**; never place parents in the output.

IDENTITY & REGION WEIGHTS
• Global identity follows **Image B (MOM) = target 95% resemblance**.
• Iris color/pattern comes from the **DAD** (from Image A). Match exactly; no averaging.

NATURAL MICRO-ASYMMETRY (avoid studio symmetry)
Introduce subtle L/R offsets:
• eye aperture **2–4%**,
• one brow **1–2 mm** higher,
• smile corner **1–2 mm** higher,
• tiny **nostril width** offset,
• head yaw **~1–2°** and a slightly irregular hair part.

AGE LOOK (child anatomy)
Fuller cheeks, softer jaw and mentolabial angle, **slightly shorter philtrum** than MOM yet preserving her proportion rhythm. Remove adult artifacts (wrinkles, makeup, stubble).

EYES (neutral-open; do not inherit squint)
• Treat any parental squint as scene noise — **do not copy**.

HAIR & BROWS
• Hair family from MOM, **2% lighter than MOM** with subtle **sun-kissed ends**, a few flyaways and baby hairs near the part.
• Brows same hue family, **10% lighter than the hair**, softer/sparser with child density.

COMPOSITION & LIGHT
Medium close head-and-shoulders, eyes near the upper third, subject **centered**, camera at eye level, distance **~1.6–1.8 m**, lens **85–105 mm eq**, vertical **4:5**.
Subject fills **48–55%** of the frame; **do not crop the forehead**. 
Background: outdoor park/greenery with creamy bokeh.
Lighting: warm golden-hour rim/backlight on hair + gentle, natural frontal fill.

TWO-PASS LIKENESS CHECK (self-correction)
After the first render, internally evaluate resemblance to Image B:
• If overall likeness < ~90% or the child reads too generic:
  – increase MOM bias an extra **+8–12%** specifically for **mouth, philtrum, nose tip/alar width, chin outline, cheekbone height**,
  – add micro-asymmetry offsets again (values above) if the face looks bilater
Re-render once with these corrections.

DO NOT
No extra people, no CGI/cartoon look, no heavy makeup, no extreme bilateral symmetry, no text/borders/watermarks, no cloning of a parent’s face.

OUTPUT
PNG, **1536×1920 (4:5)**.
