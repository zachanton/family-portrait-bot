Generate one vertical 9:16 portrait  of a **7-year-old girl**. External camera (not a selfie). The child must read instantly as a real kid and clearly resemble the person from the second reference image.

INPUTS
• Image A — both parents (palette & global genetics).
• Image B — MOM face crop (traits anchor).
Use references as **traits only**; never place parents in the output.

IDENTITY & REGION WEIGHTS
• Global identity follows Image B (MOM) = target 90–93% resemblance **while preserving child craniofacial ratios (larger cranial vault vs mandible, fuller cheeks, shorter philtrum). Never transfer adult age markers**
• Iris color/pattern comes from the **DAD** (from Image A). Match exactly; do not average or brighten.
• If father's iris is not clearly visible in Image A, **fallback to MOM’s iris color/pattern** with the same “match exactly; do not average or brighten”.

EYES — REALISTIC, NOT “DOLL-LIKE”
• Neutral-open gaze; **do not inherit** any squint from references.
• Keep natural human scale: **do not enlarge eyes** or over-open lids; **upper lid slightly overlaps the iris**, lower lid relaxed.
•Pupils **exposure-appropriate** (outdoor daytime: mid–small); limbal ring subtle; sclera brightness natural.
• One or two **soft catchlights** consistent with scene lighting; avoid mirrored/symmetric highlights.

NATURAL MICRO-ASYMMETRY (avoid studio symmetry)
Introduce subtle L/R offsets:
• eye aperture **2–4%**,
• one brow **1–2 mm** higher,
• smile corner **1–2 mm** higher,
• tiny **nostril width** offset,
• head yaw **~1–2°** and a slightly irregular hair part.

AGE LOOK (child anatomy)
Fuller cheeks, softer jaw and mentolabial angle, **slightly shorter philtrum** than MOM yet preserving her proportion rhythm.
**Nose and alar width remain childlike and not narrower than the scaled MOM proportion.**
Remove adult artifacts (wrinkles, makeup, stubble) and avoid adult-style lip contouring.

SKIN TEXTURE & TONE
Preserve fine skin texture and faint freckles; **no plastic smoothing, pore removal, or HDR micro-contrast**.
Moderate contrast and saturation; warm-neutral white balance; natural highlight roll-off (no glossy specular sheen).

HAIR & BROWS
• Hair family from MOM, **~2% lighter** with subtle **sun-kissed ends**, a few flyaways and baby hairs near the part.
• Brows same hue family, **~10% lighter than the hair**, softer/sparser with child density.

COMPOSITION & LIGHT (LOCK)
Medium close head-and-shoulders; eyes near the upper third; subject **centered**; camera at eye level; distance **~1.6–1.8 m**; lens **85–105 mm eq**; vertical **9:16**.
Subject fills **48–55%** of the frame; **do not crop the forehead**.
Background: outdoor park/greenery with creamy bokeh.
Lighting: warm golden-hour rim/backlight on hair + gentle, natural frontal fill.
Ensure **physically consistent** shadows/reflections and recomputed catchlights for this light setup.

TWO-PASS LIKENESS & REALISM CHECK (self-correction)
After the first render, internally evaluate resemblance to Image B and realism:
• If overall likeness < ~90% **or the face looks stylized/“doll-like”**:
  – increase MOM bias +8–12% for mouth, philtrum, chin outline, cheekbone height; **for nose tip/alar width keep childlike width; do not narrow below child proportion**.
  – reduce overall eye aperture by 2–3% **symmetrically**, **retain the L/R micro-asymmetry values**.
  – re-apply the micro-asymmetry offsets above.
Re-render once with these corrections.


DO NOT
No matte; no grey areas; no extra people; **no oversized eyes**; no CGI/cartoon look; no heavy makeup; **no extreme bilateral symmetry**; **no beauty-filter skin**; **no HDR sharpening/halos**; no text/borders/watermarks; no cloning of a parent’s face.

OUTPUT
PNG full-bleed.
