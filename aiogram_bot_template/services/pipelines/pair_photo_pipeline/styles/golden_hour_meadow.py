STYLE_OPTIONS = {
  "Candid Embrace Close-Up": """Light: Warm, low-angle golden hour sun acts as a strong rim/hair light from camera-right. Soft frontal fill from a large bounce or open sky to keep faces luminous and shadows soft.
Grade: Warm, cinematic color grade. Skin tones have a golden bias; background greens are rich and desaturated. Medium contrast with slightly lifted blacks. Subtle halation/bloom on highlights.
Atmosphere: Visible sun flare (kept off faces), soft light, dust motes visible in the backlight, gentle breeze suggested in hair.
Wardrobe: Coordinated soft neutrals and earthy tones (cream, beige, oatmeal, rust, olive green). Natural, flowing fabrics like cotton, linen. No logos or busy patterns.
Finish: Micro-cleanup only (stray hairs, distracting elements). Preserve natural skin texture and asymmetry.""",

  "Picnic Blanket Snuggle": """Light: Soft, directional golden hour light. Backlight or 3/4 backlight to create a beautiful hair rim light. Use a large reflector for soft, even fill on their faces, creating clean catchlights.
Grade: Natural, warm color palette. Clean skin tones. Medium contrast. Background is rendered in soft, warm bokeh with hints of pastel wildflowers.
Atmosphere: Peaceful, late afternoon meadow setting. No distracting elements in the background.
Wardrobe: Smart casual and comfortable. For instance, Woman in a light-colored sundress or linen top, Man in a soft henley shirt and chinos.
Finish: Preserve all identity features. No skin smoothing. Focus is on a clean, timeless, and romantic portrait.""",

  "Sunlit Path Hand-in-Hand": """Light: Strong backlight from the setting sun, creating a golden halo effect around both subjects. A large, soft fill light from the front to properly expose faces and retain detail.
Grade: High-dynamic-range look with rich shadows and warm, glowing highlights. Skin tones are kept natural and warm. Restrained saturation on background elements.
Atmosphere: Dreamy, slightly hazy feel. The path behind them is an abstract element of leading lines.
Wardrobe: Flowing, comfortable clothing that catches the light and breeze. Woman in a long skirt or dress, Man in a soft button-down shirt.
Finish: Focus on a clean, emotional image. All unique facial features must be preserved perfectly.""",
