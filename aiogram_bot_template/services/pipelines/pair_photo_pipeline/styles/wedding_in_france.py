FRAMING_OPTIONS = {
  "Eiffel Tower Serenade": """Single, unbroken frame. NO split-screen or collage. Waist-up vertical crop. **Absolute priority is perfect identity match.**
Blocking: Couple stands on a classic Parisian balcony or terrace, with the Eiffel Tower softly blurred into the golden hour bokeh behind them. MAN on LEFT, WOMAN on RIGHT. Maintain natural height/head ratios.
Pose: A gentle, intimate embrace. His arms are wrapped around her waist from behind; her hands rest softly on his forearms. She leans her head back slightly onto his shoulder.
Gazes: He looks down at her with adoration; she looks towards the camera with a soft, happy smile. Both faces must be completely unobstructed.
Optics: ≈85 mm portrait look; very shallow DOF (f/2.2-f/2.8) to render the background and city lights into a dreamy, painterly bokeh. Clean, round catchlights in the eyes are essential.""",

  "Haussmann Balcony Embrace": """Single, unbroken frame. Tight chest-up vertical crop. **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Identity lock over atmosphere. Faces MUST be a perfect match.**
Blocking: Couple is on a classic Parisian Haussmann-style balcony with ornate wrought-iron railings. Shot from a slightly low angle to add a touch of glamour. WOMAN on LEFT, MAN on RIGHT. Maintain natural height/head ratios.
Pose: They stand close, facing each other in a three-quarters profile. He gently cups her cheek, his thumb resting along her jawline. Her hand rests on his chest.
Gazes: They are looking deeply into each other's eyes, sharing an intimate moment. A gentle, knowing smile on both their faces.
Optics: ≈105 mm for beautiful compression; shallow DOF (f/2.8-f/4) to blur the street scene below into soft shapes and colors. The morning light provides a soft, flattering key light.""",

  "Château Garden Stroll": """Single, unbroken frame. Mid-shot (from the knees up) vertical crop. **Absolute priority is perfect identity match.**
Blocking: Couple is walking hand-in-hand through the manicured gardens of a French château. The path leads the viewer's eye towards them. MAN on RIGHT, WOMAN on LEFT. Maintain natural height/head ratios.
Pose: A candid moment during a stroll. They are walking slowly, holding hands. He might be whispering something to her, causing her to laugh or smile genuinely. A sense of gentle movement.
Gazes: She looks at him, laughing or smiling. He looks forward with a proud, happy expression, or glances at her.
Optics: ≈70-85 mm look; shallow DOF to blur the background of lush greenery, fountains, or architectural elements of the château into a soft, elegant backdrop.""",

  "Louvre Pyramid Twilight Kiss": """Single, unbroken frame. Tight chest-up vertical crop. **Absolute priority is perfect identity match.**
Blocking: Couple stands before the glowing Louvre Pyramid at twilight. The pyramid's geometric lines are softly blurred in the background. WOMAN on RIGHT, MAN on LEFT. Maintain natural height/head ratios.
Pose: An intimate forehead-to-forehead moment. Their hands are gently on each other's arms or waist. It's a quiet, personal moment against a grand backdrop.
Gazes: Eyes are closed or looking tenderly at each other, capturing a moment of pure connection. No direct look at the camera.
Optics: ≈85mm portrait look; shallow DOF (f/2.8) to create beautiful bokeh from the pyramid's lights and any city lights in the distance. The wet ground can create stunning reflections.""",

  "Provençal Lavender Sunset": """Single, unbroken frame. Wider mid-shot (waist-up) to capture the vastness of the lavender fields. **Absolute priority is perfect identity match.**
Blocking: Couple is in the middle of a blooming lavender field in Provence during sunset. The rows of lavender create strong leading lines. MAN on LEFT, WOMAN on RIGHT. Maintain natural height/head ratios.
Pose: A dynamic and joyful pose. He is spinning her gently, and her dress is flowing around her. A moment of pure, uninhibited happiness.
Gazes: Both are laughing, sharing a candid moment of joy. Their gazes are on each other, not the camera.
Optics: ≈50-70mm lens to capture more of the environment; shallow DOF (f/4) to keep both faces in focus during movement while still blurring the distant background. Strong sun flare is encouraged.""",

  "Montmartre Café Moment": """Single, unbroken frame. Candid waist-up shot. **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Identity lock over everything else.**
Blocking: Couple is seated at a tiny, round bistro table outside a classic Parisian café on a cobblestone street in Montmartre. MAN on RIGHT, WOMAN on LEFT. Maintain natural height/head ratios.
Pose: A captured, authentic interaction. He is telling a story, leaning in, while she is laughing, her head tilted slightly. Her hand rests on his. A cup of coffee or a glass of wine is on the table.
Gazes: They are looking at each other with genuine amusement and affection, completely engrossed in their own world.
Optics: ≈50mm for a natural, documentary-style feel; very shallow DOF (f/2.0) to isolate the couple from the bustling street scene, turning passersby and lights into soft, abstract bokeh.""",

STYLE_OPTIONS = {
  "Eiffel Tower Serenade": """Light: Warm, low-angle golden hour sun acts as a strong rim/hair light. A large, soft reflector provides frontal fill to keep faces luminous and shadows soft, creating beautiful, clean catchlights.
Grade: Cinematic color grade with warm golden and magenta tones in the sky, contrasted with the cool blues of twilight. Skin tones remain natural and warm. Medium contrast with slightly lifted blacks for a filmic feel.
Atmosphere: Romantic, dreamy, and slightly hazy Parisian evening. The focus is entirely on the couple's emotion, with the iconic landmark serving as a beautiful, abstract backdrop.
Wardrobe: MAN in a classic black tuxedo with a bow tie or a dark navy suit. WOMAN in an elegant ivory or champagne wedding gown (e.g., A-line or mermaid silhouette) made of silk or lace.
Finish: Micro-cleanup only (stray hairs, distracting elements). Preserve natural skin texture, freckles, and asymmetry. No skin smoothing or reshaping.""",

  "Haussmann Balcony Embrace": """Light: Soft, diffused morning light. The sun is rising, casting a gentle, warm glow on their faces. No harsh shadows. The light should feel clean and airy.
Grade: A light and airy color grade. Pastel tones with clean whites and natural skin tones. Low contrast for a soft, romantic feel. Inspired by fine-art wedding photography.
Atmosphere: Quiet, intimate, and personal. It feels like a private moment stolen away from the world on a beautiful Paris morning.
Wardrobe: MAN in a light-colored suit (e.g., beige linen or light gray wool) with an open-collar white shirt. WOMAN in a simple yet chic and modern wedding dress, perhaps with delicate straps or off-the-shoulder details.
Finish: **Identity lock is paramount.** All unique facial features must be preserved perfectly. No beauty filters. The image should feel timeless and authentic.""",

  "Château Garden Stroll": """Light: Soft, overcast daylight or the gentle light of the late afternoon. This creates soft, flattering shadows and brings out the rich colors of the garden.
Grade: A natural and vibrant color grade. Lush, deep greens in the foliage, contrasted with the warm, natural skin tones of the couple. Clean and timeless edit.
Atmosphere: Elegant, serene, and classic. The grandeur of the château gardens provides a timeless and luxurious backdrop.
Wardrobe: A slightly more relaxed but still formal look. MAN could wear a tailored suit without a tie. WOMAN in a flowing, ethereal wedding gown that moves beautifully as she walks.
Finish: **Absolute identity preservation is the top priority.** No skin smoothing. The final image should look like a page from a high-end wedding magazine.""",

  "Louvre Pyramid Twilight Kiss": """Light: A dramatic dual-lighting setup. The main light is the cool, soft ambient light of the blue hour. A strong, warm, golden light emanates from the glowing pyramid, acting as a powerful rim light and fill light, sculpting their faces.
Grade: A modern, cinematic color grade. A sophisticated take on the teal-and-orange look, with deep blues in the shadows and rich, golden highlights. Skin tones must remain natural and pleasing.
Atmosphere: Magical, epic, and quiet. A moment of intimacy in a grand, world-famous location. Reflections on the wet ground around the pyramid add to the visual splendor.
Wardrobe: Formal evening wear. MAN in a sharp, perfectly tailored black tuxedo. WOMAN in a sleek, modern, and elegant wedding gown, perhaps with some sparkle or metallic detail to catch the light.
Finish: **Preserve identity above all else.** The final image must feel like a high-fashion editorial, while retaining the exact likeness of the couple.""",

  "Provençal Lavender Sunset": """Light: Intense, low golden-hour sun acts as a strong backlight, creating a brilliant golden halo around the couple and making the lavender fields glow. A large, soft fill light from the front ensures their faces are beautifully lit.
Grade: Vibrant, warm, and saturated. Deep purples and blues in the lavender, fiery oranges and yellows in the sky. Skin tones are kept warm and radiant to match the sunset.
Atmosphere: Dreamy, joyful, and full of life. The air is filled with the golden light of sunset, with visible sun flare and glowing dust motes.
Wardrobe: Bohemian and romantic. MAN in a light-colored linen suit (no tie). WOMAN in a flowing, bohemian-style lace dress with long sleeves that catches the breeze.
Finish: **The likeness must be perfect.** Despite the dynamic pose and dramatic lighting, the faces must be an exact match to the reference photos. No beautification.""",

  "Montmartre Café Moment": """Light: Soft, ambient street lighting from lampposts, complemented by a warm, inviting glow from the café window, which acts as the key light.
Grade: A nostalgic, filmic look. Warm mid-tones, slightly lifted blacks (not crushed), and a very subtle grain to emulate classic film photography. Colors are rich but not overly saturated.
Atmosphere: Authentic, intimate, and candid. The background is filled with the soft bokeh of streetlights, other café patrons (as blurs), and the charming architecture of Montmartre.
Wardrobe: Chic and stylish Parisian "smart casual". MAN in a tweed blazer or a stylish wool coat over a simple shirt. WOMAN in an elegant silk blouse or a knit dress.
Finish: **Identity is the number one priority.** The goal is to create a believable, captured moment that perfectly retains the couple's unique features.""",
