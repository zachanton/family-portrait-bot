STYLE_DEFINITION = "A warm, candid family portrait in a sunlit meadow during the golden hour."

FRAMING_OPTIONS = {
#   "Candid Embrace Close-Up": """Single, unbroken frame. Waist-up to chest-up crop.
# Blocking: MOTHER on LEFT, FATHER on RIGHT, CHILD slightly in front, between them. All three in a gentle, relaxed group hug.
# Pose: Parents' bodies angled slightly toward the child. Hands are natural: mother's hand on child's shoulder, father's arm around child's waist. All faces are clearly visible and unobstructed.
# Gazes: All looking towards the camera with soft, happy smiles.
# Optics: ≈85–105 mm portrait look; shallow DOF; clean round/oval catchlights.""",

#   "Park Bench Portrait": """Single, unbroken frame. Seated on a rustic wooden park bench. Mid-shot framing (from the knees up).
# Blocking: MOTHER and FATHER seated, CHILD standing or sitting between them.
# Pose: Relaxed posture. Child might be leaning back against one parent. Parents' arms can rest on the bench back or be around the child. All faces unobstructed.
# Gazes: All looking towards thecamera with warm, gentle expressions.
# Optics: ≈85 mm; shallow DOF; background trees and path softly blurred.""",

#   "Walking Path Perspective": """Single, unbroken frame. A soft, out-of-focus walking path or field behind the family. Mid-shot to three-quarters framing.
# Blocking: MOTHER-CHILD-FATHER in a line, shoulders slightly overlapping for connection.
# Pose: Standing, close together. Parents' near hands might be holding the child's hands or resting on their shoulders. A sense of relaxed unity.
# Gazes: All directed towards the camera with natural smiles.
# Optics: ≈105 mm for compression; shallow DOF to melt the background away; clean catchlights.""",

  "Camera Check Close-Up": """Single, unbroken frame. A dynamic composition with significant depth.
Blocking: CHILD is in the FOREGROUND and large in the frame, slightly off-center, occupying the lower half. MOTHER and FATHER are in the MIDDLE GROUND, smaller and positioned behind the child, creating a triangular composition.
Pose: The child looks directly at the camera with a cheerful expression, as if they have just set up the camera timer. One of the child's hands might be partially visible, dropping down after pressing the shutter. The parents are standing close together, looking warmly over the child's head towards the camera, waiting with relaxed smiles.
Gazes: All three subjects look towards the camera with natural, happy expressions.
Optics: ≈70-85mm lens perspective. A very shallow depth of field (e.g., f/1.8-f/2.8) is critical. Focus is tack-sharp on the CHILD's eyes, while the parents are softly and pleasingly out of focus, yet clearly recognizable.

STYLE_OPTIONS = {
#   "Candid Embrace Close-Up": """Light: Warm, low-angle golden hour sun as a key or rim light from camera-left or right. Soft frontal fill from a large bounce or open sky to keep faces luminous and shadows soft.
# Grade: Warm skin tones with a golden bias; background greens are rich and desaturated. Medium contrast with slightly lifted blacks. Subtle halation/bloom on highlights.
# Atmosphere: Visible sun flare (kept off faces), soft light, gentle breeze suggested in hair.
# Wardrobe: Coordinated soft neutrals and earthy tones (cream, beige, oatmeal, rust, olive green). Natural fabrics like cotton, linen. No logos or busy patterns.
# Finish: Micro-cleanup only (stray hairs, distracting elements). Preserve natural skin texture and asymmetry.""",

#   "Park Bench Portrait": """Light: Soft, directional golden hour light. Backlight or 3/4 backlight to create a beautiful hair rim light on all three subjects. Use a large reflector for soft, even fill on their faces.
# Grade: Natural, warm color palette. Clean skin tones. Medium contrast. Background is rendered in soft, warm bokeh.
# Atmosphere: Peaceful, late afternoon park setting. No distracting elements in the background.
# Wardrobe: Smart casual. For instance, Mother in a light-colored sundress, Father in a linen shirt and chinos, Child in a simple, complementary outfit.
# Finish: Preserve all identity features. No skin smoothing. Focus is on a clean, timeless portrait.""",

#   "Walking Path Perspective": """Light: Strong backlight from the setting sun, creating a golden halo effect around all three family members. A large, soft fill light from the front to properly expose faces and retain detail.
# Grade: High-dynamic-range look with rich shadows and warm, glowing highlights. Skin tones are kept natural and warm. Restrained saturation on background elements.
# Atmosphere: Dreamy, slightly hazy feel. The path behind them is an abstract element of leading lines.
# Wardrobe: Flowing, comfortable clothing that catches the light and breeze. Mother in a long skirt or dress, Father in a soft-button down shirt, Child in light colors.
# Finish: Focus on a clean, emotional image. All unique facial features must be preserved perfectly.""",

  "Camera Check Close-Up": """Light: The low golden-hour sun backlights the parents, creating a beautiful rim light that separates them from the background. This same light catches the child's hair. A large, soft fill light from the front illuminates the child's face, making it the brightest and clearest point of interest.
Grade: A warm, cinematic color grade with golden and amber tones on the subjects, contrasting with the background. Skin tones are rendered naturally. The background is a dreamy, impressionistic field of flowers, rendered in a bokeh of vibrant pinks, magenta, and blush, with cool blue and lavender tones woven into the shadows. Green foliage is minimized, allowing the floral colors and the evening sky to dominate the palette.
Atmosphere: Dreamy and candid. Sun flare is encouraged, but it should not directly hit or obscure any of the faces. A sense of warmth and spontaneous joy.
Wardrobe: Coordinated, comfortable clothing in rich, dark colors like deep navy, burgundy, forest green, or charcoal. The dark tones create a beautiful contrast against the bright, floral background. Natural fabrics like cotton or wool blends work well. No logos or busy patterns.
Finish: Preserve natural skin texture for all three individuals. The focus is on capturing a candid, emotion-filled moment with perfect identity preservation, despite the depth of field.
